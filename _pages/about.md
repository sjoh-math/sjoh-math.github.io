Welcome to my webpage!

I am a PhD student in the department of Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University, advised by [Sung-Soo Byun](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsoobyun/welcome). I am also a member of [SNU Probability Group](https://sites.google.com/view/snuprob/).

I am interested in Random Matrix Theory, Mathematical Physics, and Probability.
